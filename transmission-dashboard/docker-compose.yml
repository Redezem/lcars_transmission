    # When using network_mode: "host", the container shares the host's network.
    # Nginx inside the container will listen on port 8080 (as per nginx.conf).
    # This port 8080 will be directly on the host's network interface.
    # The 'ports' directive here is more for documentation/awareness in host mode,
    # as it doesn't establish a typical Docker NAT mapping.
